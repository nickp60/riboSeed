Description
===============

riboSeed is an supplemental assembly refinement method to try to address
the issue of multiple ribosomal regions in a genome, as these create
repeates unresolvable by short read sequencing. It takes advantage of
the fact that while each region is identical, the regions flanking are
unique, and therefore can potentially be used to seed an assembly in
such a way that rDNA regions are bridged.

The pipeline consists of 3 main stages: preprocessing, de fere novo
assembly, and visualization/assessment.
