## Reference Selection
`riboSeed` requires an appropriate reference genome for the *de fere novo* assembly.  We recommend using [PlentyOfBugs.](http://github.com/nickp60/plentyofbugs), which simplifies this process by comparing a preliminary assembly of your isolate to existing reference genomes.

## Before We Start
Please back up any and all data used, and work within a virtualenv.

Genome assembly gobbles RAM. If you, like me, are working on a 4gb RAM lappy, don't run riboSeed in parallel and instead run in series by using the `--serialize` option.  That should prevent you from running out of RAM during the final SPAdes calls.

## Description

riboSeed is an supplemental assembly refinement method to try to address the issue of multiple ribosomal regions in a genome, as these create repeats unresolvable by short read sequencing.  It takes advantage of the fact that while each region is identical, the regions flanking are unique, and therefore can potentially be used to seed an assembly in such a way that rDNA regions are bridged.

For a description of each submodule, follow the links below to the readthedocs manual page.

## Installation

### From conda (new and recommended!)
Conda is a cross-platform, cross-language package management system.  If you haven't already installed conda, follow [these instructions here](https://bioconda.github.io/index.html), and install the python3 version.  Once you have that done, install riboSeed and all of its dependencies with one command:

```
conda install riboseed
```

(Note the lowercase "s")


#### From Pypi
riboSeed is on Pypi, so you can install with pip, preferably within a virtualenv (recommended):

```
virtualenv -p python3.5 venv-riboSeed
source venv-riboSeed/bin/activate
pip3.5 install riboSeed
```


#### From TestPypi
To install the bleeding-edge version, install from testpypi:
```
virtualenv -p python3.5 venv-riboSeed
source venv-riboSeed/bin/activate
pip install --extra-index-url https://testpypi.python.org/pypi riboSeed
```

#### From GitHub
You can also clone this repository, and run `python setup.py install`.

### Dependencies
Python requirements can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.

### External Requirements
External requirements can be found in the `environment.yml`, and can be used to create a conda environment: (`conda env create -f environment.yml`)

NOTE: barrnap has certain Perl requirements that may not be included on your machine. Ensure barrnap runs fine before trying `ribo snag`.  Or try [python barrnap](https://github.com/nickp60/barrnap/).


## Suggested Running

The `ribo run` command orchestrates the most commonly used sequence of calls to `scan`, `select`, `seed`, `sketch`, `score`, and so on.

```
usage: ribo run [-r reference.fasta] -c config_file [-o /output/dir/]
                [-n experiment_name] [-K {bac,euk,arc,mito}] [-S 16S:23S:5S]
                [--clusters str] [-C str] [-F reads_F.fq] [-R reads_R.fq]
                [-S1 reads_S.fq] [-s int]
                [--ref_as_contig {ignore,infer,trusted,untrusted}] [--linear]
                [-j] [--score] [-l int] [-k 21,33,55,77,99,127]
                [--force_kmers] [-p 21,33,55,77,99] [-d int] [--clean_temps]
                [-i int] [-v {1,2,3,4,5}] [--cores int] [--memory int]
                [--damn_the_torpedos] [-t {1,2,4}] [-z] [-h] [--version]

Run the riboSeed pipeline of scan, select, seed, sketch, and score. Uses a
config file to wrangle all the args not available via these commandline args.
This can either be run by providing (as minimum) a reference, some reads, and
an output directory; or, if you have a completed config file, you can run it
with just that.

optional arguments:
  -r reference.fasta, --reference_fasta reference.fasta

                        or more chromosomal sequences in fasta format.

                        help in the final assembly, as the long reads
                        generated by riboSeed contain kmers longer than the

### Known Bugs

#### X server

You may run into issues where you get an error about "Unable to connect to X server: None" or localhost:N. Sorry about that; any tips would be useful;  a quick glance at the commit history will show I have spent much time trying to resolve it, without any luck.  If you do run into this, try the following:
  - connect to the machine with an X session (`ssh -X hostname`)
  - avoid using `gnu screen` if possible, but if you do need to use it, start the `screen` session after ensuring you have a `$DISPLAY` availible through starting the host session with `-X`


#### Pysam on MacOS
If you are on MacOS, you may run into an issue with Pysam.
```
ImportError: dlopen(/Users/nicholas/miniconda3/envs/ribo/lib/python3.5/site-packages/pysam/libchtslib.cpython-35m-darwin.so, 2): Library not loaded: @rpath/liblzma.5.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/nicholas/miniconda3/envs/ribo/lib/libhts.2.dylib
  Reason: Incompatible library version: libhts.2.dylib requires version 8.0.0 or later, but liblzma.5.dylib provides version 6.0.0
```
The simplest solution is to pip instal pysam, forcing the original to be overwritten:

```
pip install pysam -U
```

In cases where this does not work, try installing by first making a conda env with the `environment.yaml` file, and then installing riboSeed from pip.
```
conda env create -y environment.yaml
source activate ribo
pip install riboSeed
```

If you run into malloc issues similar to https://github.com/ablab/spades/issues/9, we recommend running in a VM.

#### smalt scoring
Submitting `--smalt_scoring` with vastly different scoring schemes usually causes an error.

### Running Tests

The tests for the module can be found under the `tests` directory. I run them with the unittests module.  The tests assume the installation of all the recommended tools.
