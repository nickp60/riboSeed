abstract = {Background: The fast reduction of prices of DNA sequencing allowed rapid accumulation of genome data. However, the process of obtaining complete genome sequences is still very time consuming and labor demanding. In addition, data produced from various sequencing technologies or alternative assemblies remain underexplored to improve assembly of incomplete genome sequences. Findings: We have developed FGAP, a tool for closing gaps of draft genome sequences that takes advantage of different datasets. FGAP uses BLAST to align multiple contigs against a draft genome assembly aiming to find sequences that overlap gaps. The algorithm selects the best sequence to fill and eliminate the gap. Conclusions: FGAP reduced the number of gaps by 78{\%} in an E. coli draft genome assembly using two different sequencing technologies, Illumina and 454. Using PacBio long reads, 98{\%} of gaps were solved. In human chromosome 14 assemblies, FGAP reduced the number of gaps by 35{\%}. All the inserted sequences were validated with a reference genome using QUAST. The source code and a web tool are available at http://www.bioinfo.ufpr.br/fgap/.},

abstract = {Despite the development in DNA sequencing technology, improving the number and the length of reads, the process of reconstruction of complete genome sequences, the so called genome assembly, is still complex. Only 13{\%} of the prokaryotic genome sequencing projects have been completed. Draft genome sequences deposited in public databases are fragmented in contigs and may lack the full gene complement. The aim of the present work is to identify assembly errors and improve the assembly process of bacterial genomes. The biological patterns observed in genomic sequences and the application of a priori information can allow the identification of misassembled regions, and the reorganization and improvement of the overall de novo genome assembly. GFinisher starts generating a Fuzzy GC skew graphs for each contig in an assembly and follows breaking down the contigs in critical points in order to reassemble and close them using jFGap. This has been successfully applied to dataset from 96 genome assemblies, decreasing the number of contigs by up to 86{\%}. GFinisher can easily optimize assemblies of prokaryotic draft genomes and can be used to improve the assembly programs based on nucleotide sequence patterns in the genome. The software and source code are available at http://gfinisher.sourceforge.net/. After twenty years of the publication of the first bacterial genomes, only 13{\%} of the prokaryotic genome sequenc-ing projects in public databases is completely finished and the remaining deposited draft genome sequences have an average of 190 contigs 1 . The task of assembly the complete sequence of prokaryotic genomes using a shotgun approach and the short reads dataset provided by DNA sequencers and remains a challenge for Bioinformatists 2 . The taxonomic classification, the identification of genes and the prediction of the metabolic pathways, and also the amplification of regions of biotechnological interest may be difficult in draft genomes containing a large num-ber of contigs 3 . All genome assemblers are based on the assumption of sequence overlap among read sequences in a dataset to extend the sequences into contigs and reconstruct the original DNA sequence. However, the presence of repetitive regions, and errors introduced by the sequencing process can make the process unfeasible or very difficult computationally leading to genome misassemblies. The identification of repeat regions is hampered due to errors in bases calling and in the depth of coverage variation 4},

However, a limiting step of genome sequencing is the finishing process, needed to infer the relative position of each contig and close sequencing gaps. An additional degree of complexity is given by bacterial species harboring more than one replicon, which are not contemplated by the currently available programs. The availability of a large number of bacterial genomes allows geneticists to use complete genomes (possibly from the same species) as templates for contigs mapping. Here we present CONTIGuator, a software tool for contigs mapping over a reference genome which allows the visualization of a map of contigs, underlining loss and/or gain of genetic elements and permitting to finish multipartite genomes. The functionality of CONTIGuator was tested using four genomes, demonstrating its improved performances compared to currently available programs. Our approach appears efficient, with a clear visualization, allowing the user to perform comparative structural genomics analysis on draft genomes. CONTIGuator is a Python script for Linux environments and can be used on normal desktop machines and can be downloaded from http://contiguator.sourceforge.net.},

abstract = {Background: The evolution of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has considerably reduced the cost per sequenced-base, allowing a significant rise of sequencing projects, mainly in prokaryotes. However, the range of available NGS platforms requires different strategies and software to correctly assemble genomes. Different strategies are necessary to properly complete an assembly project, in addition to the installation or modification of various software. This requires users to have significant expertise in these software and command line scripting experience on Unix platforms, besides possessing the basic expertise on methodologies and techniques for genome assembly. These difficulties often delay the complete genome assembly projects. Results: In order to overcome this, we developed SIMBA (SImple Manager for Bacterial Assemblies), a freely available web tool that integrates several component tools for assembling and finishing bacterial genomes. SIMBA provides a friendly and intuitive user interface so bioinformaticians, even with low computational expertise, can work under a centralized administrative control system of assemblies managed by the assembly center head. SIMBA guides the users to execute assembly process through simple and interactive pages. SIMBA workflow was divided in three modules: (i) projects: allows a general vision of genome sequencing projects, in addition to data quality analysis and data format conversions; (ii) assemblies: allows de novo assemblies with the software Mira, Minia, Newbler and SPAdes, also assembly quality validations using QUAST software; and (iii) curation: presents methods to finishing assemblies through tools for scaffolding contigs and close gaps. We also presented a case study that validated the efficacy of SIMBA to manage bacterial assemblies projects sequenced using Ion Torrent PGM.},

abstract = {Background: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has transformed metagenomics because the high-throughput data allow an in-depth exploration of a complex microbial community. However, accurate species identification with NGS data is challenging because NGS sequences are relatively short. Assembling 16S rDNA segments into longer sequences has been proposed for improving species identification. Current approaches, however, either suffer from amplification bias due to one single primer or insufficient 16S rDNA reads in whole genome sequencing data. Results: Multiple primers were used to amplify different 16S rDNA segments for 454 sequencing, followed by 454 read classification and assembly. This permitted targeted sequencing while reducing primer bias. For test samples containing four known bacteria, accurate and near full-length 16S rDNAs of three known bacteria were obtained. For real soil and sediment samples containing dioxins in various concentrations, 16S rDNA sequences were lengthened by 50{\%} for about half of the non-rare microbes, and 16S rDNAs of several microbes reached more than 1000 bp. In addition, reduced primer bias using multiple primers was illustrated. Conclusions: A new experimental and computational pipeline for obtaining long 16S rDNA sequences was proposed. The capability of the pipeline was validated on test samples and illustrated on real samples. For dioxin-containing samples, the pipeline revealed several microbes suitable for future studies of dioxin chemistry. Background},

abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is an important nosocomial and community-acquired pathogen. Its genetic plasticity has facilitated the evolution of many virulent and drug-resistant strains, presenting a major and constantly changing clinical challenge. We sequenced the approximately 2.8-Mbp genomes of two disease-causing S. aureus strains isolated from distinct clinical settings: a recent hospital-acquired representative of the epidemic methicillin-resistant S. aureus EMRSA-16 clone (MRSA252), a clinically important and globally prevalent lineage; and a representative of an invasive community-acquired methicillin-susceptible S. aureus clone (MSSA476). A comparative-genomics approach was used to explore the mechanisms of evolution of clinically important S. aureus genomes and to identify regions affecting virulence and drug resistance. The genome sequences of MRSA252 and MSSA476 have a well conserved core region but differ markedly in their accessory genetic elements. MRSA252 is the most genetically diverse S. aureus strain sequenced to date: approximately 6{\%} of the genome is novel compared with other published genomes, and it contains several unique genetic elements. MSSA476 is methicillin-susceptible, but it contains a novel Staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (SCC) mec-like element (designated SCC(476)), which is integrated at the same site on the chromosome as SCCmec elements in MRSA strains but encodes a putative fusidic acid resistance protein. The crucial role that accessory elements play in the rapid evolution of S. aureus is clearly illustrated by comparing the MSSA476 genome with that of an extremely closely related MRSA community-acquired strain; the differential distribution of large mobile elements carrying virulence and drug-resistance determinants may be responsible for the clinically important phenotypic differences in these strains.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing technologies promise to transform the fields of genetics and comparative biology by delivering tens of thousands of genomes in the near future. Although it is feasible to construct de novo genome assemblies in a few months, there has been relatively little attention to what is lost by sole application of short sequence reads. We compared the recent de novo assemblies using the short oligonucleotide analysis package (SOAP), generated from the genomes of a Han Chinese individual and a Yoruban individual, to experimentally validated genomic features. We found that de novo assemblies were 16.2{\%} shorter than the reference genome and that 420.2 megabase pairs of common repeats and 99.1{\%} of validated duplicated sequences were missing from the genome. Consequently, over 2,377 coding exons were completely missing. We conclude that high-quality sequencing approaches must be considered in conjunction with high-throughput sequencing for comparative genomics analyses and studies of genome evolution. The plummeting costs and massive throughput of second-generation sequencing platforms are paving the way for de novo sequencing applications to characterize the genomes of thousands of species. Recently, researchers from the Beijing Genome Institute sequenced the cucumber genome using both capillary sequencing and Illumina technology 1 , and the panda genome was the first mammalian genome to be assembled using sequence data generated solely using next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms 2 . An international consortium of scientists proposes more ambitious projects, such as the Genome 10K Project to sequence the genomes of 10,000 vertebrate species 3 . The information obtained from sequencing these genomes will help us better understand genome evolution, providing rapid access to gene models from many more organisms than previously anticipated. However, a critical assessment of NGS genome assemblies should be performed in comparison to known standards, and a robust classification of what is missing from the assemblies needs to be taken into account. Such analyses are essential to correctly perform comparative genomics studies. Typical genome assembly standards, such as complete cDNA libraries or sequences from large-insert genomic clones that sample the genome do not yet exist for newly sequenced genomes such as the cucumber and panda and are unlikely to be generated to test the assembly quality. We can, however, compare the recently generated de novo sequence assemblies of two human individuals 4 with the human reference genome 5,6 to assess the limitations of such genomes assembled primarily with short reads.

abstract = {Bacterial genomes reflect their adaptation strategies through nucleotide usage trends found in their chromosome composition. Bacteria, unlike eukaryotes contain a wide range of genomic G+C. This wide variability may be viewed as a response to environmental adaptation. Two overarching trends are observed across bacterial genomes, the first, correlates genomic G+C to environmental niches and lifestyle, while the other utilizees intra-genomic G+C incongruence to delineate horizontally transferred material. In this review, we focus on the influence of several properties including biochemical, genetic flows, selection biases, and the biochemical-energetic properties shaping genome composition. Outcomes indicate a trend toward high G+C and larger genomes in free-living organisms, as a result of more complex and varied environments (higher chance for horizontal gene transfer). Conversely, nutrient limiting and nutrient poor environments dictate smaller genomes of low GC in attempts to conserve replication expense. Varied processes including translesion repair mechanisms, phage insertion and cytosine degradation has been shown to introduce higher AT in genomic sequences. We conclude the review with an analysis of current bioinformatics tools seeking to elicit compositional variances and highlight the practical implications when using such techniques.},

Here we report the complete chromosome sequence of an O157:H7 strain isolated from the Sakai outbreak, and the results of genomic comparison with a benign laboratory strain, K-12 MG1655. The chromosome is 5.5 Mb in size, 859 Kb larger than that of K-12. We identified a 4.1-Mb sequence highly conserved between the two strains, which may represent the fundamental backbone of the E. coli chromosome. The remaining 1.4-Mb sequence comprises of O157:H7-specific sequences, most of which are horizontally transferred foreign DNAs. The predominant roles of bacteriophages in the emer-gence of O157:H7 is evident by the presence of 24 prophages and prophage-like elements that occupy more than half of the O157:H7-specific sequences. The O157:H7 chromosome encodes 1632 proteins and 20 tR-NAs that are not present in K-12. Among these, at least 131 proteins are assumed to have virulence-related functions. Genome-wide codon usage analysis suggested that the O157:H7-specific tRNAs are involved in the efficient expression of the strain-specific genes. A complete set of the genes specific to O157:H7 pre-sented here sheds new insight into the pathogenicity and the physiology of O157:H7, and will open a way to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the O157:H7 infection.},

abstract = {The Shannon entropy is a standard measure for the order state of symbol sequences, such as, for example, DNA sequences. In order to incorporate correlations between symbols, the entropy of n-mers (consecutive strands of n symbols) has to be determined. Here, an assay is presented to estimate such higher order entropies (block entropies) for DNA sequences when the actual number of observations is small compared with the number of possible outcomes. The n-mer probability distribution underlying the dynamical process is reconstructed using elementary statistical principles: The theorem of asymptotic equi-distribution and the Maximum Entropy Principle. Constraints are set to force the constructed distributions to adopt features which are characteristic for the real probability distribution. From the many solutions compatible with these constraints the one with the highest entropy is the most likely one according to the Maximum Entropy Principle. An algorithm performing this procedure is expounded. It is tested by applying it to various DNA model sequences whose exact entropies are known. Finally, results for a real DNA sequence, the complete genome of the Epstein Barr virus, are presented and compared with those of other information carriers (texts, computer source code, music). It seems as if DNA sequences possess much more freedom in the combination of the symbols of their alphabet than written language or computer source codes.},

abstract = {Many publications have demonstrated the huge potential of NGS methods in terms of new species 
discovery, environment monitoring, ecological studies, etc. [
24,35,
92,97,103
]. Undoubtedly, NGS 
will become one the major tools for species identification and for routine diagnostic use. While read 
lengths are still quite short for most existing systems ranging between 50 bp and 800 bp, they are 
likely  to  improve  soon.  This  will  e
nable  easier,  faster,  and  more  reliable  contig  assembly  and subsequent  matching  against  reference  databases.  When  data  generation  is  no  longer  a 
bottleneck, the storage, speed of analysis, and interpretation of DNA sequence data are becoming 
the major chal
lenges. Also, the integration or the use of data originating from diverse datasets and 
a variety of data providers are serious issues that need to be addressed. Poor sequence record 
annotations  and  species  name  assignments  are  known  problems  that  should  be
instantly 
addressed and would allow the creation of reference databases used for routine diagnostics based 
on NGS. Samples with huge amounts of short DNA fragments need to be analyzed and compared 
against reference databases in an efficient and fast way. 
Although a number of solutions have 
been proposed by Industry; offering commercial software, there still remain hurdles to take. One of 
the  challenges  that  we  need  to  address  is  data  upload  from  client's  computers  to  central  or 
distributed  data  storage  an
d  analysis  services.  Another  one  is  the  efficient  parallelization  of 
analyses using cloud or grid solutions. The reliability and up
-
time of storage and analyses facilities 
is  another  important  problem  that  need  to  be  addressed  if  one  wants  to  use  it  for  ro
utine 
diagnostics. Finally, the management, reporting and visualization of the analyses results are among 
the  last  issues,  but  not  the  least  challenging  ones.  Considering  the  constant  growth  of 
computational power and storage capacity needed by different b
ioinformatics applications, working 
with single or a limited number of servers is no longer realistic. Using a cloud environment and grid 
computing  is  becoming  a  must.  Even  single  cloud  service  provider  can  be  restrictive  for 
bioinformatics  applications  an
d  working  with more  than one  cloud  can make the  workflow more 
robust in the face of failures and always growing capacity needs. 
In this white paper we review the 
current state of the art in this field. We discuss the main limitations and challenges 
that we
need to 
address such as;  data upload from client's computers to central or distributed  data  storage and 
analysis services; efficient parallelization of analyses using grid solutions; reliability and up
-
time of 
storage and analyses facilities for routine d
iagnostics; 
management, retrieving and visualization of 
the analyses results. },

abstract = {The lion's share of bacteria in various environments cannot be cloned in the laboratory and thus cannot be sequenced using existing technologies. A major goal of single-cell genomics is to complement gene-centric metagenomic data with whole-genome assemblies of unculti-vated organisms. Assembly of single-cell data is challenging because of highly non-uniform read coverage as well as elevated levels of sequencing errors and chimeric reads. We de-scribe SPAdes, a new assembler for both single-cell and standard (multicell) assembly, and demonstrate that it improves on the recently released E + V -SC assembler (specialized for single-cell data) and on popular assemblers Velvet and SoapDeNovo (for multicell data). SPAdes generates single-cell assemblies, providing information about genomes of un-cultivatable bacteria that vastly exceeds what may be obtained via traditional metagenomics studies. SPAdes is available online (http://bioinf.spbau.ru/spades). It is distributed as open source software.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package. AVAILABILITY http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli is an important component of the biosphere and is an ideal model for studies of processes involved in bacterial genome evolution. Sixty-one publically available E. coli and Shigella spp. sequenced genomes are compared, using basic methods to produce phylogenetic and proteomics trees, and to identify the pan-and core genomes of this set of sequenced strains. A hierarchical clustering of variable genes allowed clear separation of the strains into clusters, including known pathotypes; clinically relevant serotypes can also be resolved in this way. In contrast, when in silico MLST was performed, many of the various strains appear jumbled and less well resolved. The predicted pan-genome comprises 15,741 gene families, and only 993 (6{\%}) of the families are represented in every genome, comprising the core genome. The variable or 'accessory' genes thus make up more than 90{\%} of the pan-genome and about 80{\%} of a typical genome; some of these variable genes tend to be co-localized on genomic islands. The diversity within the species E. coli, and the overlap in gene content between this and related species, suggests a continuum rather than sharp species borders in this group of Enterobacteriaceae.},

When the genome sequence became available, conventional repeat prediction programs were used to find these repeats, but only a fraction could be identified. To exhaustively characterize the repeats we applied a new massive sequencing based strategy: we re-sequenced the genome by next generation sequencing, aligned the sequencing reads to the genome and assembled all multiple-hit reads into contigs corresponding to the repetitive part of the genome. We present here, for the first time, this de novo repeat assembly strat-egy and we confirm that such assembly is feasible. We identified and annotated 4,143 new repeats in the S. mansoni genome. At least one third of the repeats are transcribed. This strategy allowed us also to iden-tify 14 new microsatellite markers, which can be used for pedigree studies.

abstract = {The G+C content of a genome is frequently used in taxonomic descriptions of species and genera. In the past it has been determined using conventional, indirect methods, but it is nowadays reasonable to calculate the DNA G+C content directly from the increasingly available and affordable genome sequences. The expected increase in accuracy, however, might alter the way in which the G+C content is used for drawing taxonomic conclusions. We here re-estimate the literature assumption that the G+C content can vary up to 3–5 {\%} within species using genomic datasets. The resulting G+C content differences are compared with DNA–DNA hybridization (DDH) similarities calculated in silico using the GGDC web server, with 70 {\%} similarity as the gold standard threshold for species boundaries. The results indicate that the G+C content, if computed from genome sequences, varies no more than 1 {\%} within species. Statistical models based on larger differences alone can reject the hypothesis that two strains belong to the same species. Because DDH similarities between two non-type strains occur in the genomic datasets, we also examine to what extent and under which conditions such a similarity could be ,70 {\%} even though the similarity of either strain to a type strain was ¢70 {\%}. In theory, their similarity could be as low as 50 {\%}, whereas empirical data suggest a boundary closer (but not identical) to 70 {\%}. However, it is shown that using a 50 {\%} boundary would not affect the conclusions regarding the DNA G+C content. Hence, we suggest that discrepancies between G+C content data provided in species descriptions on the one hand and those recalculated after genome sequencing on the other hand ¢1 {\%} are due to significant inaccuracies of the applied conventional methods and accordingly call for emendations of species descriptions.},

abstract = {The availability of a large number of completely sequenced bacterial genomes allows the rapid and reliable determination of intragenomic sequence heterogeneity of 16S rRNA genes. In the present study we assessed the intragenomic sequence heterogeneity of 16S rRNA genes in 55 bacterial genomes, representing various phylogenetic groups. The total number of rRNA operons in genomes included ranged from 2 to 13. The maximum number of nucleotides that were different between any pair of 16S rRNA genes within a genome ranged from 0 to 19. The corresponding minimal similarity ranged from 100 to 98.74{\%}. This indicates that the intragenomic heterogeneity between multiple 16S rRNA operons in these genomes is rather limited and is unlikely to have a profound effect on the classification of taxa. Among the multiple copies of the 16S rRNA genes present in the genomes included, 199 mutations were counted with transitions being the dominant type of mutations over the total length of the 16S rRNA gene. Most heterogeneity occurred in variable regions V1, V2, and V6. {\ss} 2003 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.},

abstract = {The ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) encode the major rRNA species of the ribosome, and thus are essential across life. These genes are highly repetitive in most eukaryotes, forming blocks of tandem repeats that form the core of nucleoli. The primary role of the rDNA in encoding rRNA has been long understood, but more recently the rDNA has been implicated in a number of other important biological phenomena, including genome stability, cell cycle, and epigenetic silencing. Noncoding elements, primarily located in the intergenic spacer region, appear to mediate many of these phenomena. Although sequence information is available for the genomes of many organisms, in almost all cases rDNA repeat sequences are lacking, primarily due to problems in assembling these intriguing regions during whole genome assemblies. Here, we present a method to obtain complete rDNA repeat unit sequences from whole genome assemblies. Limitations of next generation sequencing (NGS) data make them unsuitable for assembling complete rDNA unit sequences; therefore, the method we present relies on the use of Sanger whole genome sequence data. Our method makes use of the Arachne assembler, which can assemble highly repetitive regions such as the rDNA in a memory-efficient way. We provide a detailed step-by-step protocol for generating rDNA sequences from whole genome Sanger sequence data using Arachne, for refining complete rDNA unit sequences, and for validating the sequences obtained. In principle, our method will work for any species where the rDNA is organized into tandem repeats. This will help researchers working on species without a complete rDNA sequence, those working on evolutionary aspects of the rDNA, and those interested in conducting phylogenetic footprinting studies with the rDNA.},

abstract = {Advances in sequencing technology have drastically increased the depth and feasibility of bacterial genome sequencing. However, little information is available that details the specific techniques and procedures employed during genome sequencing despite the large numbers of published genomes. Shotgun approaches employed by second-generation sequencing platforms has necessitated the development of robust bioinformatics tools for in silico assembly, and complete assembly is limited by the presence of repetitive DNA sequences and multi-copy operons. Typically, re-sequencing with multiple platforms and laborious, targeted Sanger sequencing are employed to finish a draft bacterial genome. Here we describe a novel strategy based on the identification and targeted sequencing of repetitive rDNA operons to expedite bacterial genome assembly and finishing. Our strategy was validated by finishing the genome of Paenibacillus polymyxa strain CR1, a bacterium with potential in sustainable agriculture and bio-based processes. An analysis of the 38 contigs contained in the P. polymyxa strain CR1 draft genome revealed 12 repetitive rDNA operons with varied intragenic and flanking regions of variable length, unanimously located at contig boundaries and within contig gaps. These highly similar but not identical rDNA operons were experimentally verified and sequenced simultaneously with multiple, specially designed primer sets. This approach also identified and corrected significant sequence rearrangement generated during the initial in silico assembly of sequencing reads. Our approach reduces the required effort associated with blind primer walking for contig assembly, increasing both the speed and feasibility of genome finishing. Our study further reinforces the notion that repetitive DNA elements are major limiting factors for genome finishing. Moreover, we provided a step-by-step workflow for genome finishing, which may guide future bacterial genome finishing projects.},

Comparison of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence has emerged as a preferred genetic technique. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis can better identify poorly described, rarely isolated, or phenotypically aberrant strains, can be routinely used for identification of mycobacteria, and can lead to the recognition of novel pathogens and noncultured bacteria. Problems remain in that the sequences in some databases are not accurate, there is no consensus quantitative definition of genus or species based on 16S rRNA gene sequence data, the proliferation of species names based on minimal genetic and phenotypic differences raises communication difficulties, and microheterogeneity in 16S rRNA gene sequence within a species is common. Despite its accuracy, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis lacks widespread use beyond the large and reference laboratories because of technical and cost considerations. Thus, a future challenge is to translate information from 16S rRNA gene sequencing into convenient biochemical testing schemes, making the accuracy of the genotypic identification available to the smaller and routine clinical microbiology laboratories.},

abstract = {Molecular structures and sequences are gen-erally more revealing of evolutionary relationships than are classical phenotypes (particularly so among microorganisms). Consequently, the basis for the definition of taxa has progres-sively shifted from the organismal to the cellular to the molec-ular level. Molecular comparisons show that life on this planet divides into three primary groupings, commonly known as the eubacteria, the archaebacteria, and the eukaryotes. The three are very dissimilar, the differences that separate them being of a more profound nature than the differences that separate typical kingdoms, such as animals and plants. Unfortunately, neither of the conventionally accepted views of the natural relationships among living systems-i.e., the five-kingdom taxonomy or the eukaryote-prokaryote dichotomy-reflects this primary tripartite division of the living world. To remedy this situation we propose that a formal system of organisms be established in which above the level of kingdom there exists a new taxon called a "domain." Life on this planet would then be seen as comprising three domains, the Bacteria, the Ar-chaea, and the Eucarya, each containing two or more king-doms. (The Eucarya, for example, contain Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, and a number of others yet to be defined.) Although taxonomic structure within the Bacteria and Eucarya is not treated herein, Archaea is formally subdivided into the two kingdoms Euryarchaeota (encompassing the methanogens and their phenotypically diverse relatives) and Crenarchaeota (comprising the relatively tight clustering of extremely ther-mophilic archaebacteria, whose general phenotype appears to resemble most the ancestral phenotype of the Archaea).

abstract = {SUMMARY Bacterial genomes are simpler than mammalian ones, and yet assembling the former from the data currently generated by high-throughput short-read sequencing machines still results in hundreds of contigs. To improve assembly quality, recent studies have utilized longer Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) reads or jumping libraries to connect contigs into larger scaffolds or help assemblers resolve ambiguities in repetitive regions of the genome. However, their popularity in contemporary genomic research is still limited by high cost and error rates. In this work, we explore the possibility of improving assemblies by using complete genomes from closely related species/strains. We present Ragout, a genome rearrangement approach, to address this problem. In contrast with most reference-guided algorithms, where only one reference genome is used, Ragout uses multiple references along with the evolutionary relationship among these references in order to determine the correct order of the contigs. Additionally, Ragout uses the assembly graph and multi-scale synteny blocks to reduce assembly gaps caused by small contigs from the input assembly. In simulations as well as real datasets, we believe that for common bacterial species, where many complete genome sequences from related strains have been available, the current high-throughput short-read sequencing paradigm is sufficient to obtain a single high-quality scaffold for each chromosome.

After the new assembly process, using WGM as scaffolder, we detected a large inversion with size bigger than one-half of genome.

The importance of incorporating low-copy nuclear genes in phylogenetic reconstruction is well-recognized, but has largely been constrained by technical limitations (Zimmer and Wen, 2013). These data are essential for reconstructing the evolu-tionary history of plants, including understanding the causes of observed incongruities among gene trees that arise from incom-plete lineage sorting and introgressive hybridization. The com-bination of solution hybridization for target enrichment of specifi c genomic regions and the high sequencing throughput of current platforms (e.g., Illumina) provides the opportunity to sequence hundreds or thousands of low-copy nuclear loci ap-propriate for phylogenetic analyses in an effi cient and cost-effective manner (Cronn et al., 2012 ; Lemmon and Lemmon, 2013). Most efforts to date for targeted sequencing of plant ge-nomes for phylogenetics have been directed at the plastome (e.g., Parks et al., 2012 ; Stull et al., 2013). Recently, conserved orthologous sequences in Asteraceae (Chapman et al., 2007) were obtained via target enrichment for phylogenomics (Man-del et al., 2014). Methods have been developed to target highly or ultra-con-served elements (UCEs) in animal genomes (Faircloth et al., 2012 ; Lemmon and Lemmon, 2013 ; McCormack et al., 2013). However, UCEs in plants are nonsyntenic, and are hypothe-sized to have originated via horizontal transfer from organelles or de novo evolution (Reneker et al., 2012). Whatever their ori-gin, their potential for nonorthology among species makes them unsuitable as phylogenetic markers in plants. The frequency of polyploidy throughout angiosperm evolution (Jiao et al., 2011) also impedes obtaining a large set of conserved orthologous single-copy loci transferable across plant lineages, which in combination with the lack of orthologous UCEs, means that de-sign of targeted sequencing strategies for plant nuclear genomes will necessarily be lineage-specifi c. Here we present Hyb-Seq, a protocol that combines target enrichment of low-copy nuclear genes and genome skimming (Straub et al., 2012), the use of low-coverage shotgun se-quencing to assemble high-copy genomic targets. Our proto-col improves upon the methods of Mandel et al. (2014) by (1) utilizing the genome and transcriptome of a single species for probe design, which makes our approach more generally ap-plicable to any plant lineage; (2) obtaining additional data from the procedure through combination with genome skim-ming; and (3) developing a data analysis pipeline that maxi-mizes the data usable for phylogenomic analyses.

Cheaper and faster sequencing technologies make it easy to generate very high coverage of bacterial genomes, but these advances mean that DNA preparation costs can exceed the cost of sequencing for small genomes. The need to contain costs often results in the creation of only a single sequencing library, which in turn introduces new chal-lenges for genome assembly methods. Results: We evaluated the ability of multiple genome assembly pro-grams to assemble bacterial genomes from a single, deep-coverage library. For our comparison, we chose bacterial species spanning a wide range of GC content and measured the contiguity and accuracy of the resulting assemblies. We compared the assemblies produced by this very high-coverage, one-library strategy to the best assemblies created by two-library sequencing, and we found that remarkably good bacterial assemblies are possible with just one library. We also measured the effect of read length and depth of coverage on assem-bly quality and determined the values that provide the best results with current algorithms.},

abstract = {Background: Next Generation Sequencing technologies are able to provide high genome coverages at a relatively low cost. However, due to limited reads' length (from 30 bp up to 200 bp), specific bioinformatics problems have become even more difficult to solve. De novo assembly with short reads, for example, is more complicated at least for two reasons: first, the overall amount of " noisy " data to cope with increased and, second, as the reads' length decreases the number of unsolvable repeats grows. Our work's aim is to go at the root of the problem by providing a pre-processing tool capable to produce (in-silico) longer and highly accurate sequences from a collection of Next Generation Sequencing reads. Results: In this paper a seed-and-extend local assembler is presented. The kernel algorithm is a loop that, starting from a read used as seed, keeps extending it using heuristics whose main goal is to produce a collection of error-free and longer sequences. In particular, GapFiller carefully detects reliable overlaps and operates clustering similar reads in order to reconstruct the missing part between the two ends of the same insert. Our tool's output has been validated on 24 experiments using both simulated and real paired reads datasets. The output sequences are declared correct when the seed-mate is found. In the experiments performed, GapFiller was able to extend high percentages of the processed seeds and find their mates, with a false positives rate that turned out to be nearly negligible. Conclusions: GapFiller, starting from a sufficiently high short reads coverage, is able to produce high coverages of accurate longer sequences (from 300 bp up to 3500 bp). The procedure to perform safe extensions, together with the mate-found check, turned out to be a powerful criterion to guarantee contigs' correctness. GapFiller has further potential, as it could be applied in a number of different scenarios, including the post-processing validation of insertions/deletions detection pipelines, pre-processing routines on datasets for de novo assembly pipelines, or in any hierarchical approach designed to assemble, analyse or validate pools of sequences.

Methods for purification of amplified material, direct sequencing, cloning, sequencing, and transcription are outlined. An obligate intracellular parasite of bovine erythrocytes, Anaplasma marginale, is used as an example; its 16S rDNA was amplified, cloned, sequenced, and phylogenetically placed. Anaplasmas are related to the genera Rickettsia and Ehrlichia. In addition, 16S rDNAs from several species were readily amplified from material found in lyophilized ampoules from the American Type Culture Collection. By use of this method, the phylogenetic study of extremely fastidious or highly pathogenic bacterial species can be carried out without the need to culture them.

abstract = {Advances in sequencing technology allow genomes to be sequenced at vastly decreased costs. However, the assembled data frequently are highly fragmented with many gaps. We present a practical approach that uses Illumina sequences to improve draft genome assemblies by aligning sequences against contig ends and performing local assemblies to produce gap-spanning contigs. The continuity of a draft genome can thus be substantially improved, often without the need to generate new data. Background The complete genome sequence of an organism provides an invaluable resource to the wider research community and is the foundation for comparative and evolutionary genomics studies. With the recent advances in second-generation sequencing technologies (454 pyrosequenc-ing, Illumina, SOLiD, and Helicos), genome projects have seen an explosion of sequence data production at a frac-tion of the per-base cost. However, this cost reduction is compromised by typically shorter sequence lengths, and unique profiles of sequencing errors compared with con-ventional capillary reads [1]. This leads to new computa-tional challenges in assembly to address each of these differences as well as subsequent downstream analyses. The performance of de novo assembly software depends heavily on the sequence length, depth of sequence coverage (genome equivalents, or fold cover-age), fragment size of the templates that are sequenced and the types of sequence errors specific to each technol-ogy. The situation is complicated by the range of assem-bly software that exists for use with second-generation technologies. For example, Newbler, produced by Roche, specifically addresses 454 read-specific error profiles. A range of assemblers are available for de novo assembly of Illumina reads, including Velvet [2], Abyss [3], SOAPden-ovo [4] and ALLPATHS2 [5], each of which is designed with a different aim and functionality.

abstract = {While new sequencing technologies have ushered in an era where microbial genomes can be easily sequenced, the goal of routinely producing high-quality draft and finished genomes in a cost-effective fashion has still remained elusive. Due to shorter read lengths and limitations in library construction protocols, shotgun sequencing and assembly based on these technologies often results in fragmented assemblies. Correspondingly, while draft assemblies can be obtained in days, finishing can take many months and hence the time and effort can only be justified for high-priority genomes and in large sequencing centers. In this work, we revisit this issue in light of our own experience in producing finished and nearly-finished genomes for a range of microbial species in a small-lab setting. These genomes were finished with surprisingly little investments in terms of time, computational effort and lab work, suggesting that the increased access to sequencing might also eventually lead to a greater proportion of finished genomes from small labs and genomics cores.},

However, the presence of regions with repetitive sequences, in addition to the short reads produced by the Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platforms, created a lot of difficulty in reconstructing the original genome in silico. Thus, even today, genome assembly continues to be one of the major challenges in bioinformatics specifically when repetitive sequences are considered. In this paper, we present an approach to assemble repetitive regions in prokaryotic genomes. Our methodology enables (i) the identification of these regions through visual tools, (ii) the characterization of sequences on the extremities of gaps and (iii) the extraction of consensus sequences based on mapping of raw data to a reference genome. We also present a case study on the assembly of regions that encode ribosomal RNAs (rRNA) in the genome of Corynebacterium ulcerans FRC11, in order to show the efficiency of the strategies presented here. The proposed methods and tools will help in finishing genome assemblies, besides reducing the running time and associated costs. All scripts are available at: http://github.com/dcbmariano/maprepeat},

abstract = {Background: Reading the nucleotides from two ends of a DNA fragment is called paired-end tag (PET) sequencing. When the fragment length is longer than the combined read length, there remains a gap of unsequenced nucleotides between read pairs. If the target in such experiments is sequenced at a level to provide redundant coverage, it may be possible to bridge these gaps using bioinformatics methods. Konnector is a local de novo assembly tool that addresses this problem. Here we report on version 2.0 of our tool. Results: Konnector uses a probabilistic and memory-efficient data structure called Bloom filter to represent a k-mer spectrum -all possible sequences of length k in an input file, such as the collection of reads in a PET sequencing experiment. It performs look-ups to this data structure to construct an implicit de Bruijn graph, which describes (k-1) base pair overlaps between adjacent k-mers. It traverses this graph to bridge the gap between a given pair of flanking sequences. Conclusions: Here we report the performance of Konnector v2.0 on simulated and experimental datasets, and compare it against other tools with similar functionality. We note that, representing k-mers with 1.5 bytes of memory on average, Konnector can scale to very large genomes. With our parallel implementation, it can also process over a billion bases on commodity hardware. Background},

Amplified 16S rDNAs obtained from both Vibrio parahaemolyticus and an environmental strain were cloned. Their nucleotide sequences revealed differences of up to 2 {\%} among 16S rDNAs from the same strain. Polymorphic sites were concentrated in a recognized variable stem–loop of bacterial 16S rRNA that contained in some cases up to 83 {\%} of the total mismatches observed. Most of the substitutions present in the stem–loop region showed compensating base covariation. The accumulation of so many compensating changes in the stem–loop region implies that the divergence of the different versions of this stem–loop is relatively ancient.

SOAPdenovo has been successfully applied to assemble many published genomes, but it still needs improvement in continuity, accuracy and coverage, especially in repeat regions. FINDINGS To overcome these challenges, we have developed its successor, SOAPdenovo2, which has the advantage of a new algorithm design that reduces memory consumption in graph construction, resolves more repeat regions in contig assembly, increases coverage and length in scaffold construction, improves gap closing, and optimizes for large genome. CONCLUSIONS Benchmark using the Assemblathon1 and GAGE datasets showed that SOAPdenovo2 greatly surpasses its predecessor SOAPdenovo and is competitive to other assemblers on both assembly length and accuracy. We also provide an updated assembly version of the 2008 Asian (YH) genome using SOAPdenovo2. Here, the contig and scaffold N50 of the YH genome were {\~{}}20.9 kbp and {\~{}}22 Mbp, respectively, which is 3-fold and 50-fold longer than the first published version.

abstract = {Several characteristics of the 16S rRNA gene, such as its essential function, ubiquity, and evolutionary properties, have allowed it to become the most commonly used molecular marker in microbial ecology. However, one fact that has been overlooked is that multiple copies of this gene are often present in a given bacterium. These intragenomic copies can differ in sequence, leading to identification of multiple ribotypes for a single organism. To evaluate the impact of such intragenomic heterogeneity on the performance of the 16S rRNA gene as a molecular marker, we compared its phylogenetic and evolutionary characteristics to those of the single-copy gene rpoB. Full-length gene sequences and gene fragments commonly used for denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis were compared at various taxonomic levels. Heterogeneity found between intragenomic 16S rRNA gene copies was concentrated in specific regions of rRNA secondary structure. Such "heterogeneity hot spots" occurred within all gene fragments commonly used in molecular microbial ecology. This intragenomic heterogeneity influenced 16S rRNA gene tree topology, phylogenetic resolution, and operational taxonomic unit estimates at the species level or below. rpoB provided comparable phylogenetic resolution to that of the 16S rRNA gene at all taxonomic levels, except between closely related organisms (species and subspecies levels), for which it provided better resolution. This is particularly relevant in the context of a growing number of studies focusing on subspecies diversity, in which single-copy protein-encoding genes such as rpoB could complement the information provided by the 16S rRNA gene.},

Repeats have always presented technical challenges for sequence alignment and assembly programs. Next-generation sequencing projects, with their short read lengths and high data volumes, have made these challenges more difficult. From a computational perspective, repeats create ambiguities in alignment and assembly, which, in turn, can produce biases and errors when interpreting results. Simply ignoring repeats is not an option, as this creates problems of its own and may mean that important biological phenomena are missed.

@article{Dias2012,
abstract = {Background: Decreasing costs of DNA sequencing have made prokaryotic draft genome sequences increasingly common. A contig scaffold is an ordering of contigs in the correct orientation. A scaffold can help genome comparisons and guide gap closure efforts. One popular technique for obtaining contig scaffolds is to map contigs onto a reference genome. However, rearrangements that may exist between the query and reference genomes may result in incorrect scaffolds, if these rearrangements are not taken into account. Large-scale inversions are common rearrangement events in prokaryotic genomes. Even in draft genomes it is possible to detect the presence of inversions given sufficient sequencing coverage and a sufficiently close reference genome. Results: We present a linear-time algorithm that can generate a set of contig scaffolds for a draft genome sequence represented in contigs given a reference genome. The algorithm is aimed at prokaryotic genomes and relies on the presence of matching sequence patterns between the query and reference genomes that can be interpreted as the result of large-scale inversions; we call these patterns inversion signatures. Our algorithm is capable of correctly generating a scaffold if at least one member of every inversion signature pair is present in contigs and no inversion signatures have been overwritten in evolution. The algorithm is also capable of generating scaffolds in the presence of any kind of inversion, even though in this general case there is no guarantee that all scaffolds in the scaffold set will be correct. We compare the performance of SIS, the program that implements the algorithm, to seven other scaffold-generating programs. The results of our tests show that SIS has overall better performance. Conclusions: SIS is a new easy-to-use tool to generate contig scaffolds, available both as stand-alone and as a web server. The good performance of SIS in our tests adds evidence that large-scale inversions are widespread in prokaryotic genomes.},

abstract = {Background: Current high-throughput sequencing technologies generate large numbers of relatively short and error-prone reads, making the de novo assembly problem challenging. Although high quality assemblies can be obtained by assembling multiple paired-end libraries with both short and long insert sizes, the latter are costly to generate. Recently, GAGE-B study showed that a remarkably good assembly quality can be obtained for bacterial genomes by state-of-the-art assemblers run on a single short-insert library with very high coverage. Results: In this paper, we introduce a novel hierarchical genome assembly (HGA) methodology that takes further advantage of such very high coverage by independently assembling disjoint subsets of reads, combining assemblies of the subsets, and finally re-assembling the combined contigs along with the original reads. Conclusions: We empirically evaluated this methodology for 8 leading assemblers using 7 GAGE-B bacterial datasets consisting of 100 bp Illumina HiSeq and 250 bp Illumina MiSeq reads, with coverage ranging from 100x–∼200x. The results show that for all evaluated datasets and using most evaluated assemblers (that were used to assemble the disjoint subsets), HGA leads to a significant improvement in the quality of the assembly based on N50 and corrected N50 metrics.},

abstract = {Dynamic programming algorithms guarantee to find the optimal alignment between two sequences. For more than a few sequences, exact algorithms become computationally impractical, and progressive algorithms iterating pairwise alignments are widely used. These heuristic methods have a serious drawback because pairwise algorithms do not differentiate insertions from deletions and end up penalizing single insertion events multiple times. Such an unrealistically high penalty for insertions typically results in overmatching of sequences and an underestimation of the number of insertion events. We describe a modification of the traditional alignment algorithm that can distinguish insertion from deletion and avoid repeated penalization of insertions and illustrate this method with a pair hidden Markov model that uses an evolutionary scoring function. In comparison with a traditional progressive alignment method, our algorithm infers a greater number of insertion events and creates gaps that are phylogenetically consistent but spatially less concentrated. Our results suggest that some insertion/deletion "hot spots" may actually be artifacts of traditional alignment algorithms.},

abstract = {Recent advances in high-throughput genome sequencing technologies have enabled the systematic study of various genomes by making whole genome sequencing affordable. Modern sequencers generate a huge number of small sequence fragments called reads, where the read length and the per-base sequencing cost depend on the technology used. To date, many hybrid genome assembly algorithms have been developed that can take reads from multiple read sources to reconstruct the original genome. However, rigorous investigation of the feasibility conditions for complete genome reconstruction and the optimal sequencing strategy for minimizing the sequencing cost has been conspicuously missing. An important aspect of hybrid sequencing and assembly is that the feasibility conditions for genome reconstruction can be satisfied by different combinations of the available read sources, opening up the possibility of optimally combining the sources to minimize the sequencing cost while ensuring accurate genome reconstruction. In this paper, we derive the conditions for whole genome reconstruction from multiple read sources at a given confidence level and also introduce the optimal strategy for combining reads from different sources to minimize the overall sequencing cost. We show that the optimal read set, which simultaneously satisfies the feasibility conditions for genome reconstruction and minimizes the sequencing cost, can be effectively predicted through constrained discrete optimization. Through extensive evaluations based on several genomes and different read sets, we verify the derived feasibility conditions and demonstrate the performance of the proposed optimal hybrid sequencing and assembly strategy.},

abstract = {Although AmpC ␤-lactamases can barely degrade carbapenems, if at all, they can sequester them and prevent them from reaching their targets. Thus, car-bapenem resistance in Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae can result from AmpC production and simultaneous reduction of antibiotic influx into the periplasm by mutations in the porin genes. Here we investigated the route and genetic mech-anisms of acquisition of carbapenem resistance in a clinical E. coli isolate carrying bla CMY-2 on a plasmid by selecting for mutants that are resistant to increasing con-centrations of meropenem. In the first step, the expression of OmpC, the only porin produced in the strain under laboratory conditions, was lost, leading to reduced sus-ceptibility to meropenem. In the second step, the expression of the CMY-2 ␤-lactamase was upregulated, leading to resistance to meropenem. The loss of OmpC was due to the insertion of an IS1 element into the ompC gene or to frame-shift mutations and premature stop codons in this gene. The bla CMY-2 gene was found to be located on an IncI␥ plasmid, and overproduction of the CMY-2 enzyme resulted from an increased plasmid copy number due to a nucleotide substitution in the inc gene. The clinical relevance of these genetic mechanisms became evident from the analysis of previously isolated carbapenem-resistant clinical isolates, which appeared to carry similar mutations.},

To elucidate the intercistronic or intraspecific variation of rrn operons, their se-quences were compared with those for the K-12 rrn operons. The rrn genes and the internal transcribed spacer regions showed a higher similarity to each other in each strain than between the corresponding operons of the two strains. However, the degree of intercistronic homogeneity was much higher in the EHEC strain than in K-12 . In contrast, promoter and terminator regions in each operons were con-served between the corresponding operons of the two strains, which exceeded intercistronic similarity.},

abstract = {Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a disruptive technology that has found widespread acceptance in the life sciences research community. The high throughput and low cost of sequencing has encouraged researchers to undertake ambitious genomic projects, especially in de novo genome sequencing. Currently, NGS systems generate sequence data as short reads and de novo genome assembly using these short reads is computationally very intensive. Due to lower cost of sequencing and higher throughput, NGS systems now provide the ability to sequence genomes at high depth. However, currently no report is available highlighting the impact of high sequence depth on genome assembly using real data sets and multiple assembly algorithms. Recently, some studies have evaluated the impact of sequence coverage, error rate and average read length on genome assembly using multiple assembly algorithms, however, these evaluations were performed using simulated datasets. One limitation of using simulated datasets is that variables such as error rates, read length and coverage which are known to impact genome assembly are carefully controlled. Hence, this study was undertaken to identify the minimum depth of sequencing required for de novo assembly for different sized genomes using graph based assembly algorithms and real datasets. Illumina reads for E.coli (4.6 MB) S.kudriavzevii (11.18 MB) and C.elegans (100 MB) were assembled using SOAPdenovo, Velvet, ABySS, Meraculous and IDBA-UD. Our analysis shows that 50X is the optimum read depth for assembling these genomes using all assemblers except Meraculous which requires 100X read depth. Moreover, our analysis shows that de novo assembly from 50X read data requires only 6-40 GB RAM depending on the genome size and assembly algorithm used. We believe that this information can be extremely valuable for researchers in designing experiments and multiplexing which will enable optimum utilization of sequencing as well as analysis resources.},

abstract = {Motivation: Despite considerable advancements in sequencing and computing technologies, de novo assembly of whole eukaryotic genomes is still a time-consuming task that requires a significant amount of computational resources and expertise. A targeted assembly approach to perform local assembly of sequences of interest remains a valuable option for some applications. This is especially true for gene-centric assemblies, whose resulting sequence can be readily utilized for more focused biological re-search. Here we describe Kollector, an alignment-free targeted assembly pipeline that uses thousands of transcript sequences concurrently to inform the localized assembly of corresponding gene loci. Kollector robustly reconstructs introns and novel sequences within these loci, and scales well to large genomes— properties that makes it especially useful for researchers working on non-model eukaryotic organisms. Results: We demonstrate the performance of Kollector for assembling complete or near-complete Caenorhabditis elegans and Homo sapiens gene loci from their respective, input transcripts. In a time-and memory-efficient manner, the Kollector pipeline successfully reconstructs respectively 99{\%} and 80{\%} (compared to 86{\%} and 73{\%} with standard de novo assembly techniques) of C.elegans and H.sapiens transcript targets in their corresponding genomic space using whole gen-ome shotgun sequencing reads. We also show that Kollector outperforms both established and re-cently released targeted assembly tools. Finally, we demonstrate three use cases for Kollector, including comparative and cancer genomics applications. Availability and Implementation: Kollector is implemented as a bash script, and is available at},

abstract = {Determining the genomic sequences of microorganisms is the basis and prerequisite for understanding their biology and functional characterization. While the advent of low-cost, extremely high-throughput second-generation sequencing technologies and the parallel development of assembly algorithms have generated rapid and cost-effective genome assemblies, such assemblies are often unfinished, fragmented draft genomes as a result of short read lengths and long repeats present in multiple copies. Third-generation, PacBio sequencing technologies circumvented this problem by greatly increasing read length. Hybrid approaches including ALLPATHS-LG, PacBio corrected reads pipeline, SPAdes, and SSPACE-LongRead, and non-hybrid approaches—hierarchical genome-assembly process (HGAP) and PacBio corrected reads pipeline via self-correction—have therefore been proposed to utilize the PacBio long reads that can span many thousands of bases to facilitate the assembly of complete microbial genomes. However, standardized procedures that aim at evaluating and comparing these approaches are currently insufficient. To address the issue, we herein provide a comprehensive comparison by collecting datasets for the comparative assessment on the above-mentioned five assemblers. In addition to offering explicit and beneficial recommendations to practitioners, this study aims to aid in the design of a paradigm positioned to complete bacterial genome assembly. T he advent of second-generation sequencing technology has changed the traditional Sanger sequencing paradigm. The decrease in expense associated with sequencing genomic data has made this technology broadly accessible, and now decentralized laboratories can afford to execute their own internal genome sequencing projects 1,2 . However, owing to genome complexity, even for microbial genome reconstruction, it remains challenging to generate complete genome assemblies using second-generation sequencing data 3,4},

abstract = {Background: The availability of diverse second-and third-generation sequencing technologies enables the rapid determination of the sequences of bacterial genomes. However, identifying the sequencing technology most suitable for producing a finished genome with multiple chromosomes remains a challenge. We evaluated the abilities of the following three second-generation sequencers: Roche 454 GS Junior (GS Jr), Life Technologies Ion PGM (Ion PGM), and Illumina MiSeq (MiSeq) and a third-generation sequencer, the Pacific Biosciences RS sequencer (PacBio), by sequencing and assembling the genome of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, which consists of a 5-Mb genome comprising two circular chromosomes. Results: We sequenced the genome of V. parahaemolyticus with GS Jr, Ion PGM, MiSeq, and PacBio and performed de novo assembly with several genome assemblers. Although GS Jr generated the longest mean read length of 418 bp among the second-generation sequencers, the maximum contig length of the best assembly from GS Jr was 165 kbp, and the number of contigs was 309. Single runs of Ion PGM and MiSeq produced data of considerably greater sequencing coverage, 279× and 1,927×, respectively. The optimized result for Ion PGM contained 61 contigs assembled from reads of 77× coverage, and the longest contig was 895 kbp in size. Those for MiSeq were 34 contigs, 58× coverage, and 733 kbp, respectively. These results suggest that higher coverage depth is unnecessary for a better assembly result. We observed that multiple rRNA coding regions were fragmented in the assemblies from the second-generation sequencers, whereas PacBio generated two exceptionally long contigs of 3,288,561 and 1,875,537 bps, each of which was from a single chromosome, with 73× coverage and mean read length 3,119 bp, allowing us to determine the absolute positions of all rRNA operons. Conclusions: PacBio outperformed the other sequencers in terms of the length of contigs and reconstructed the greatest portion of the genome, achieving a genome assembly of " finished grade " because of its long reads. It showed the potential to assemble more complex genomes with multiple chromosomes containing more repetitive sequences.},

abstract = {Evolutionary analyses require sequence alignments that correctly represent evolutionary homology. Evolutionary and structural homology are not the same and sequence alignments generated with methods designed for structural matching can be seriously misleading in comparative and phylogenetic analyses. The phylogeny-aware alignment algorithm implemented in the program PRANK has been shown to produce good alignments for evolutionary inferences. Unlike other alignment programs, PRANK makes use of phylogenetic information to distinguish alignment gaps caused by insertions or deletions and, thereafter, handles the two types of events differently. As a by-product of the correct handling of insertions and deletions, PRANK can provide the inferred ancestral sequences as a part of the output and mark the alignment gaps differently depending on their origin in insertion or deletion events. As the algorithm infers the evolutionary history of the sequences, PRANK can be sensitive to errors in the guide phylogeny and violations on the underlying assumptions about the origin and patterns of gaps. These issues are discussed in detail and practical advice for the use of PRANK in evolutionary analysis is provided. The PRANK software and other methods discussed here can be found from the program home page at http://code.google.com/p/prank-msa/.},

abstract = {Waterborne Campylobacter jejuni outbreaks are common in the Nordic countries, and PFGE (pulsed field gel electrophoresis) remains the genotyping method of choice in outbreak investigations. However, PFGE cannot assess the clonal relationship between isolates, leading to difficulties in molecular epidemiological investigations. Here, we explored the applicability of whole genome sequencing to outbreak investigation by re-analysing three C. jejuni strains (one isolated from water and two from patients) from an earlier resolved Finnish waterborne outbreak from the year 2000. One of the patient strains had the same PFGE profile, as well as an identical overall gene synteny and three polymorphisms in comparison with the water strain. However, the other patient isolate, which showed only minor differences in the PFGE pattern relative to the water strain, harboured several polymorphisms as well as rearrangements in the integrated element CJIE2. We reconstructed the genealogy of these strains with ClonalFrame including in the analysis four C. jejuni isolated from chicken in 2012 having the same PFGE profile and sequence type as the outbreak strains. The three outbreak strains exhibited a paraphyletic relationship, implying that the drinking water from 2000 was probably contaminated with at least two different, but related, C. jejuni strains. Our results emphasize the capability of whole genome sequencing to unambiguously resolve the clonal relationship between isolates of C. jejuni in an outbreak situation and evaluate the diversity of the C. jejuni population.},
